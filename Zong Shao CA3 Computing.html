<p><b>What is a cyber-attack ?</b></p>
<p>A cyberattack is an effort to steal, damage, or disrupt information systems and resources within computer networks.</p>
<h1>Types of threats</h1>
<p><b>Insider Threats</p></b>
<p>Starts from individuals with legitamate systems access, that may cause problems intentionl or accidental</p>
<p><b>Outsider Threats</p></b>
<p>Starts from external entities with no system access. Like Hackers, Cybercriminal or Organized attack groups.</p>

<th>Type of Cyber-Attack</th>
<th>How it works</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>1. Malware</td>
<td>Cyberattackers use harmful software such as spyware, viruses, ransomware, and worms known as malware to access your system's data. When you click on a malicious email attachment or link, the malware can install itself and become active on your device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2. Phishing</td>
<td>Phishing attacks are social engineering attacks that rely on communication methods like email to convince you to open the message and follow the instructions inside. If you follow the attackers’ instructions, they gain access to personal data, such as credit cards, and may install malware on your device.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3. Spoofing</td>
<td>Cyber attackers will sometimes imitate people or companies to trick you into giving up personal information. These malicious activities can occur through several means, for example, a common spoofing strategy involves using a fake caller ID, where the person receiving the call doesn’t see that the number is falsified. Other spoofing methods include subverting facial recognition systems, using a fake domain name, or creating a fake website.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4. Backdoor Trojan</td>
<td>Backdoor Trojan attacks involve malicious programs that can deceptively install malware or data and open up what’s referred to as the “backdoor” to your computer system. When attackers gain access to the backdoor, they can hijack the device without it being known to the user.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>5. Ransomware</td>
<td>Ransomware is malicious software that cyberattackers can install on your device, allowing them to block your access until you pay the attackers a ransom. However, paying the ransom doesn’t guarantee the removal of the software, so experts often advise individuals targeted by ransomware attacks not to pay the ransom.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>6. Password Attacks</td>
<td>Password attacks can be as simple as someone correctly guessing your password or other methods such as keylogging, where attackers can monitor the information you type and then identify passwords. An attacker can also use the aforementioned phishing approach to masquerade as a trusted site and try to fool you into revealing your account credentials.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>7. Internet of Things Attack</td>
<td>Communication channels between connected IoT components can be susceptible to cyberattacks and the applications and software found on IoT devices. Since IoT devices are in connection with one another through the internet and may have limited security features, there is a larger attack surface that attackers can target.</td>
</td>
<tr>
<td>8. Cryptojacking</td>
<td>Cryptojacking involves gaining unauthorized use of a computer system, usually through malware that allows the attacker to use the computer's resources for mining cryptocurrency. Mining cryptocurrency can come with significant operational costs, so cryptojacking provides attackers with a way to avoid these expenses.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>9. Drive-by Download</td>
<td>Drive-by download attacks occur when you download malicious code to your device through an app, website, or operating system with flawed security systems. This means you could do nothing wrong and still be a victim of a drive-by download since it can occur due to a lack of security measures on a site you believe to be safe.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>10. Denial-of-service attack</td>
<td>A denial-of-service attack causes an entire device or operating system to shut down by overwhelming it with traffic, causing it to crash. Attackers don’t often use this method to steal information. Instead, it costs the victim time and money to get their systems up and running again. Cybercriminals typically use this method when the target is a trade organization or government entity.</td>
